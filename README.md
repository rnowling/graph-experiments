# graph-experiments
Some experiments with machine learning on graphs.  Currently, this repository only contains a script for evaluating Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers on discriminating between graphs trained with the Erdos-Renyi and planted-partition random graph models using four different ways of generating features from the distribution of all-pairs shortest-path lengths for each graph.  More details are given in my corresponding [blog post](https://rnowling.github.io/machine/learning/2017/03/03/classifying-graphs-with-shortest-paths.html).
